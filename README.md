# Vulkan-Work-in-Progress
A game not yet complete

This project is the result of a long time fascination of mine with Vulkan and endless hours of effort!

Before I start taking credit, I give a huge thanks to Mike Bailey of CS Oregon State University (CS Department)

My starting point as well as the basic working knowledge was from his SIGGRAPH Course

Please note the following:

1. I am no Vulkan expert, if you go into inner niggles, then I probably cannot explain

2. The code is full of bugs. So, don't be surprised if you find one

3. This is still work in progress! So, it is a basic interactivity test, nothing more at least as of now

4. The code uses Vulkan, GLFW3 for Display and OpenAL for Audio

5. Finally, I would like to make it clear that there can and will not be a "A getting started with Vulkan in 30 min" guide. It took nearly 3 moths to get here

6. Lots of unecessary junk is also present, collected from my previous attempts:-)

Basic File Description:

1. vulkan_c.cpp: The most important file. All Vulkan related functions are populated here (Main is also here). VulkanClass.h has the corresponding class definitions
2. Structures.h: A few useful structures
3. GameEngine.cpp: Yep, you guessed it! The game logic which is nowhere near complete
4. SampleVertexData.cpp: Just to hold the coordinates of a quad

I have also not explained the working in any manner. However, there are a few helpful comments

Personally, I am yet to fix the coordinate system. So, no game!
